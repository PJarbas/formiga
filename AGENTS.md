Instructions for AI coding assistants and developers working on the tamandua codebase.

## Development

### Build and Install

```bash
# Build from source (checkout root):
./build              # npm install + tsc + inject-version
./install            # symlink ~/.local/bin/tamandua → this checkout
./build-and-install  # both steps at once
```

The `build` script requires Node.js >= 22. It runs `npm install` followed by `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation, HTML copy, version injection).

The `install` script delegates to `scripts/install.sh --local <pwd>` — it creates a symlink so `tamandua` on your PATH always uses the dist from your checkout. No global npm install, no GitHub clone needed.

```bash
# After editing source, rebuild:
./build

# Run tests:
npm test
```

## Architecture

Tamandua is an agent team orchestrator built on top of pi (the coding agent CLI).

### Runtime model

- Agent settings live at `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
- Work is dispatched via direct `pi --print` invocation (no gateway HTTP API)
- Sessions use `pi --print --session`
- Agent config lives in `~/.tamandua/agents.json`
- Permissions are expressed as role descriptions

### Agent Scheduler

The agent scheduler uses in-memory `setInterval` timers (not OS cron) to poll agents:

1. Polling phase: cheap model checks `step peek` → HAS_WORK or NO_WORK
2. Work phase: if HAS_WORK, spawns `pi --print` with the agent's workspace and prompt
3. `runPi` emits lifecycle logs (`pi pre-launch`, `pi launched`, `pi completed`/`pi execution failed`) with PID, timing, and bounded stream preview metadata for observability without dumping full prompts or large stderr payloads
4. `executePollingRound` emits stage logs (`Polling round skipped/start/complete/failed`) with shared round context (`jobId`, `agentId`, timeout/workdir/model when available) and bounded outcome/error previews
5. Polling rounds run pi in JSON mode (`--mode json`) so scheduler logic can extract `message_end.message.usage` token metadata and attribute increments to `runs.tokens_spent` using run IDs parsed from tool outputs (with step-id fallback).
6. Successful token attribution emits a `run.tokens.updated` event (`tokenDelta` + `tokensSpent` fields); terminal run lifecycle events (`run.completed`/`run.failed`) also carry `tokensSpent` for cost visibility.

### Step Lifecycle

```
waiting → pending → running → done/failed
```

- Steps start as `waiting` (blocked by preceding steps)
- Pipeline advancement marks them `pending`
- Agent claims → `running`
- Agent completes → `done`, pipeline advances
- Agent fails → retry or escalate

## State

- SQLite database: `~/.tamandua/tamandua.db`
- Agent config: `~/.tamandua/agents.json`
- Cron jobs: `~/.tamandua/cron-jobs.json`
- Events: `~/.tamandua/events.jsonl`
- Logs: `~/.tamandua/tamandua.log`
- Medic: `~/.tamandua/medic.json`

## Skills and Agent Instructions

When making changes that affect Tamandua agent behavior, always check whether `skills/tamandua-agents/SKILL.md` needs updating. This skill is provisioned to Tamandua workflow agents as AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, and SOUL.md instructions — if the skill is outdated, agents will operate with incorrect guidance.

Changes that typically require skill updates include:
- **Step lifecycle**: modifications to step claim/complete/fail/pipeline logic
- **CLI commands**: new or changed CLI commands that agents use (step, workflow, logs, dashboard commands)
- **Agent provisioning**: changes to how personas, workspace files, or skills are provisioned to agents
- **Workflow structure**: new step types, loop wiring, or pipeline ordering changes
- **Output format contracts**: changes to expected agent output formats (e.g., STATUS/CHANGES/TESTS blocks)

If you update `skills/tamandua-agents/SKILL.md`, also verify that all bundled workflow persona AGENTS.md files reflect the change where relevant.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Or build first then test (tests import from dist/)
npm run build && npm test
```

Tests use Node's built-in `node:test` and `node:assert`.
Tests are safe for parallel execution with `node --test tests/*.test.ts src/**/*.test.ts`.

### Parallel Test Safety

Tamandua is often used to develop and test itself. A real daemon, MCP server, or dashboard may be running while `npm test` executes from this same checkout. Breaking test isolation can stop the live daemon, corrupt live `~/.tamandua` state, or make an active self-improvement run fail.

All tests use isolated temporary HOME and TAMANDUA_STATE_DIR directories per test, so PID/port files never conflict across parallel test files.

- **Random ports:** Tests that spawn listeners use `reserveRandomPort()` (bind-to-0, capture assigned port) instead of hardcoded ports. Normal tests must not bind, fetch, or probe default ports 3334/3338/3339; default-port behavior should be asserted as constants or covered behind an explicit opt-in/manual test.
- **Temp HOME isolation:** CLI integration tests create temporary HOME directories via `fs.mkdtempSync()`, pass `HOME` env to spawned CLI subprocesses, and clean up with `fs.rmSync(tempHome, { recursive: true, force: true })` in `finally` blocks. Helpers that run `dist/cli/cli.js` must require an explicit isolated env; do not fall back to raw `process.env`.
- **Scoped daemon control:** Tests must not call `stopDaemon()`, `stopMcp()`, or `stopControlPlane()` against real HOME. Pass an explicit `{ homeDir: tempHome }` or stop the exact child process handle created by the test. Do not import/unlink real pid files such as `MCP_PID_FILE` or `CONTROL_PLANE_PID_FILE` for cleanup.
- **Process cleanup safety:** If a test kills a PID from a file, first ensure that PID belongs to the test environment, for example by checking its `/proc/<pid>/environ` HOME or by using daemonctl helpers with `{ homeDir }`.
- **Guard coverage:** `tests/test-isolation-guard.test.ts` scans for patterns that can touch the live daemon. Update it when adding new service lifecycle tests.
- **Real CLI defaults remain 3334/3338/3339:** The production daemon, MCP, and control plane use ports 3334, 3338, and 3339 respectively. Only production code should use those defaults during normal automated tests.

`npm test` remains a convenience alias that runs the full parallel suite.

`src/server/mcp-server.ts` supports dependency injection via `createTamanduaMcpServer(..., { services })` / `startTamanduaMcpServer(..., { services })`; protocol tests in `src/server/mcp-server.test.ts` should use this hook instead of duplicating DB/event setup.

`src/server/daemon.ts` now starts dashboard + MCP together (dashboard port from `~/.tamandua/port`, MCP fixed to 3338). Co-lifecycle regression coverage lives in `src/server/daemon.test.ts`.

Dashboard UI regressions are covered in `src/server/dashboard.test.ts` by fetching `/` from `createDashboardServer(...)` and asserting required HTML/script hooks (including logs-tail cursor polling markup).

Bundled skill artifacts are validated in `tests/workflow-validation.test.ts` (existence, frontmatter, required command guidance, and workflow `workspace.skills` wiring).
Bundled workflows are discovered by directory under `workflows/`; `tests/workflow-validation.test.ts` asserts each directory's `workflow.yml` has a matching `id` and that every `workspace.files` path exists relative to the workflow directory.
Workflow catalog discoverability is also regression-tested there: README entries (heading + pipeline sequence) can be enforced for bundled workflows such as `feature-dev-merge`.
Bundled workflow agents that run Tamandua steps should declare `tamandua-agents` in `workspace.skills`; when adding it, preserve any existing skills like `agent-browser`.
Step output parsing (`parseOutputKeyValues` in `src/installer/step-ops.ts`) lowercases keys, so an agent output like `ORIGINAL_BRANCH: main` is consumed downstream as `{{original_branch}}`.
Installer skill copy behavior (workflow-local + shared bundled skills) is covered in `tests/agent-skill-provisioning.test.ts`.

For CLI integration tests, spawn `dist/cli/cli.js` and set temporary `TAMANDUA_STATE_DIR` plus `HOME` so event files and SQLite DB access are isolated per test.
Dashboard API integration tests should also run in a subprocess with temp `HOME` (e.g., `dist/server/dashboard.js`), because DB path resolution in `src/db.ts` is bound at module load.
